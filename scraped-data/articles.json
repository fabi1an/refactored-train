      "The students of the College of Business and Management (CBM) department actively participated in a 1-day Seminar and Workshop on Photography that was led by Sir Gerald Gulmatico Ruplo, MIT, where he discussed basic information and things to consider and remember about the world of photography and digital marketing.",
      "This activity was subdivided into two parts, wherein the first part was intended for the Seminar and discussion, and the second part was intended for the workshop where the students captured and submitted their own photo entries.",
      "This Seminar and Workshop was organized by the CBM Departmental Officers and was participated by all year levels of the BS Tourism Management and BS Business Administration – MM programs.",
      "Indeed, it was an informative and relevant activity that surely gave the students some useful insights that they can apply to level up their whole photography experiences and make their digital marketing skills more effective."

      "I am one example of a Filipino whose formative years were not all about PSP and game apps on tablets; I grew up with games played outside of the confines of our house. I grew up with games with lots of interaction with friends, family, and neighbors.",
      "In my early formative years we played piko, we socialized by patintero, tagutaguan, sungka and holen and interacted with other children by doing luksongtinik, luksonglubid and hilianglubid. As you can imagine my younger years were not only about socialization but also about the cultivation of a strong, unique culture within me.",
      "Now children are playing different games. They sit engrossed, with almost lifeless stares, playing ‘DOTA’, ‘Counter Strike’, and many other games found on computers and other electronic platforms.  Gone are the familiar ways of Filipinos. Gone is the face-to-face interaction of playing with friends, cousins and relatives. Gone is the fun-filled playful afternoon. Gone are the Philippine traditional games.",
      "To help today’s youth remember how things used to be, our Buwan ng Wika celebration included traditional larong Pinoy, which are considered vital to our heritage.",
      "This year, the college added significantly more to the number of games that were played, all of which required teamwork and intense physical activity, a departure from just sitting on the couch and pressing the buttons of an Xbox or swiping fingers on an iPad.",
      "Not only did we get in a good sweat, but we also nourished our hearts and souls. Just as they have for generations, these games can serve as a positive influence to our mental, emotional, social and moral being. Our traditions and heritage can be revived if our children take up these games all throughout their adolescent and adult lives.",
      "Yes, we will have another chance to enjoy larong Pinoy next August, but even before then, I hope we can play these games more often.",

      "Everyone came together on the dance floor as foamy suds started to pour in – and shoot out from a cannon – and danced the night away to an energetic performance from special guest DJ Tom Taus.  The party continued with sets from DJs Nathaniel “Nat” Teh, Arvin “Don Juan” Pingol, Gwens “DJ Cuteboy” Rosanto, and Kimber “DJ Princess” Victorioso.",
      "Attendees were also treated to musical numbers from some of Goldenstate’s most talented students.  After performances from ever-impressive Sinag Dance Troupe and the always-entertaining faculty, there was a dance competition, with students representing each department naenae-ing and poplocking their way into the favor of the judges’ panel, which included DJ Nat, Mr. Johann Manilay Millado, and Mr. Jon Marius Tolentino.",
      "As the name of the event would suggest, the Acquaintance Party provided an opportunity for students to get to know the Goldenstate faculty and staff.  After opening remarks from CEO Dr. Warren A. Manilay, MNSA, each teacher came on stage for a short introduction.  Overall, the Acquaintance Party was a nice way for the entire Goldenstate community to come together in the spirit of fun and camaraderie.",
      "In addition to our special guest performers, Goldenstate would like to thank the following sponsors, Tong Yang, Steven’s Place, Canto Tapsi Bar, Robinson’s, MSE, Pizza Hut at KCC, Asia Brewery, Globe Telecom, and Ton-Ton Gensan.  Special thanks also goes to the Sarangani Golfers Club, East Asia Royale Hotel, and B.

      "Spearheaded by Mr. John Manilay, Head of the Development Office, the Light-a-Tree Countdown is the culmination of the efforts of students, faculty, and staff.  Each department spent the preceding weeks decorating a tree in the courtyard.  Except for the Christmas lights, all of the decorations needed to be sourced from recycled materials.  This added challenge tested the creativity and ingenuity of each team, and on Monday evening, once the sun had set, their stunning innovations were on bright, luminous display.",
      "But first, attendees partook in a Christmas bazaar featuring food and gifts sold by each department.  Around 5 o’clock, the program officially began with opening remarks by Sir John. This was followed by a surprise birthday greeting for our CEO, Dr. Warren Manilay, MNSA.  After being serenaded by faculty and staff, Dr. Manilay offered some comments of appreciation for and reflection on his birthday, as well as acknowledgement of the hard work put in by the event’s participants.",
      "After a few more words from the night’s organizers, the entire courtyard went dark, starting the countdown.  Then came the moment everyone, especially the participants, had been waiting for: in a flash, all eight lighting designs shone, dazzling the audience.  Goldenstate had become a Yuletide wonderland.  Each tree demonstrated the artistry and resourcefulness of the designers, as items like plastic cups and CDs were repurposed into well-executed takes on Christmas icons like Nativity scenes, snowmen, and Santa Claus.  To supplement the designs, each team performed Christmas carols, ranging from traditional a cappella medleys to multipart singing-and-dancing extravaganzas.",
      "As the audience was mesmerized by a number from the always-entertaining Sinag Dance Troupe, the total scores for the tree designs and musical performances were submitted by the judging panel, composed of Sir Ferdinand Alcantara, Ma’am LJ Pulido, and Sir Joaquin Suaverdez.  Once all of the points were tabulated, it was Division 2 who had come out on top.",

      "Did you notice Division 4 is once again the overall champion of Intramurals 2014? I hear Sir. Chris Mordeno, the division’s adviser, musing about his students having to do their best to win in every activity that they will be participating, deploying all of the students that have the suitable talents and skills for the Intramurals.",
      "Goldenstate College’s Intramurals was a four-day affair, beginning on Monday at the Lagao Gymnasium with the literary and musical competitions.  Students representing the four divisions competed in the Quiz Bowl, Spelling Bee, Extemporaneous Speaking, News Casting, and Solo and Duet Singing.  In the afternoon were the final rounds of the Mr. and Ms. Goldenstate pageants.",
      "The physical competitions were held during the following three days at the Acharon Sports Complex, Calumpang.  Each division displayed exemplary sportsmanship and character while vying for the honor of being named overall champion.  Though Divison 4 would ultimately earn that distinction, it is clear that every competitor gave her or his best effort in front of the large crowd of fellow Goldenians who cheered them on.",
      "The week was capped off with exhibition games played by the faculty and staff, as well as an all-school Zumba workout.  The spirit of health and fitness was celebrated by all of Goldenstate.",
      "“This is the right time to develop good sportsmanship”, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr. Warren T. Manilay, MNSA declared during his opening remarks.  Truly, during the 2014 Intramurals, all Goldenians did just that.",
      "Our coverage of the Intramurals includes features on the Literary and Musical Competitions and the Mr. and Ms. Goldenstate pageant, both held at the Lagao Gymnasium on September 22.",
      "A Battle of Brains and Vocal Range",
      "Monday’s Literary and Musical Competitions at the began with quiz bowl followed by spelling bee all divisions performed well, but division three bagged the first place at quiz bowl and division four for spelling bee.",
      "Then came the Extemporaneous Question competition, followed by Newscasting.  As expected with anything involving multimedia coordination, there were multiple hiccups, but all participants showed their resilience.  Ultimately, Division 4 came out on top.",
      "The series of competitions ended with Solo and Duet Singing.  Again, there were some technical setbacks, but the performers persevered with absolute grace and spirit.  Through all of the competitions, each division showed their fortitude, intelligence, and creativity.",
      "Gods and Goddesses Among Us",
      "The Mr. and Ms. Goldenstate College Pageant is a perennial highlight of Intramurals. Themed this year as “Gods and Goddesses”, representatives from each division went through a series of challenges that test their beauty, grace, and wit in order to prove that they are worth the titles Mr. and Ms. Goldenstate 2014.",
      "On September 14, the candidates had their pictorial at the Ancestral House, each looking photogenic in their black-and-white formal and god- and goddess-themed costumes.  On September 20, they took to the stage to show their creativity during the Talent Competition.",
      "This all culminated in the evening of September 23 at Lagao Gymnasium.  As their final chance to prove themselves to the judges and the audience, each contestant strutted across the stage during the Costume, Casual Denim Attire, and Formalwear segments.",
      "With all of the female candidates on the stage in their formalwear, the gymnasium went wild when guest performers 1:43 entered to serenade the lovely ladies.",
      "This all lead to perhaps the most nerve-wracking portion of the pageant, the Q&A.  Each contestant anwered a randomly selected question, and despite some initial fluster on the faces of some of the candidates, each was able to issue an impassioned and articulate response.",
      "Before the coronation, a series of special awards were given.  Both awards for Best in Talent were given to students from Division 1. Peoples’ Choice were awarded to Division 2 (male) and Division 4 (female). Most Photogenic were given to Division 3 (male) and Division 4 (female). The Congeniality Awards were given Division 1.  Best in Jeans were awarded to Division 1 (male) and Division 3 (female). Students from Division 4 were named Mr. and Ms. Coca-Cola. Mr. and Ms. TM were awarded to students from Division 2. Finally, the Metro Collection Awards were given to students from Division 1.",
      "Then came the moment that everyone in Lagao Gymnasium had been waiting for—the crowning of Mr. and Ms. Goldenstate 2014.  With the crowd looking on in rapt anticipation, pageant organizer Mr. Ferdinand Alcantara announced that two students from Division 2014 were given the Mr. and Ms. Goldenstate titles.",
      "“Everyone aims to win, so every athlete do your best to achieve your goals.”",
      "Officially opened by Mr. John Manilay, the sports competitions of Intramurals 2014 were held at the Acharon Sports Complex from September 23 to 25.  Teams represent each division competed in various sports, including basketball, volleyball, kickball, soccer, takraw ,tennis, chess, track and field, long jump and darts.",
      "With the oppressive heat of the sun beating down on them, the competitors displayed their athleticism, preparation, grit, and determination in front of the screaming crowd of their peers.",
      "After the three-day series, Division 4 earned the title of overall champions.  Overall, Intramurals 2014 was a rousing success, with students and staff alike showing their talent, enthusiasm, and, most importantly, sportsmanship.",

      "Every August, the country celebrates Buwan ng Wikang Pambansa, highlighting our Filipino Language. The Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino (KWF) announced that the theme for this year’s celebration would be ‘Wikang Filipino, Wikang Pagkakaisa’.",
      "The celebration of Buwan ng Wikang Pambansa is in keeping with Presidential Proclamation No. 1041 s. 1997  (month long celebration of buwanngwika every August), meant to encourage all Filipinos, and especially the youth, to develop their appreciation for their national language by means of participation in all activities in line with the celebration and to embolden their compatriots through emphasizing greater appreciation and understanding on their traditional activities and making their language the heart and light of the nation.",
      "To make all these objectives come to life, Goldenstate College, Inc. under the supervision of the Filipino Department, led by head Filipino teacher Arnold Sugan, and with contributions from all departments, organized a two-day festival on August 28 and 29, 2014.",
      "The two-day celebration was comprised of several events, including the Slogan and Poster making contest, Sanaysay making, Tagisan at Palighasan sa mga tradisyonal na Larong Pinoy, interpretative dance, folk dance, Sabay ang bigkasan, Talumpati, Solo and Duet singing contest, and the highly-anticipated Lakandula and Lakambining Buwan ng Wika.",
      "The activity has proven to be a success in reminding Filipinos of the importance of language in achieving national progress. It has reinforced the understanding among our youth that no matter how globalization and colonialism has affected their daily lives it is imperative to value and experience all that is naturally and distinctly Filipino.",
      "Our coverage of Buwan ng Wikang Pambansa includes features on two particularly important events: the Larong Pinoy and the Lakandula and Lakambini.",
      "Larong Pinoy: Traditional Games from Yesterday Played by the Youth of Today",
      "I am one example of a Filipino whose formative years were not all about PSP and game apps on tablets; I grew up with games played outside of the confines of our house. I grew up with games with lots of interaction with friends, family, and neighbors.",
      "In my early formative years we played piko, we socialized by patintero, tagutaguan, sungka and holen and interacted with other children by doing luksongtinik, luksonglubid and hilianglubid. As you can imagine my younger years were not only about socialization but also about the cultivation of a strong, unique culture within me.",
      "Now children are playing different games. They sit engrossed, with almost lifeless stares, playing ‘DOTA’, ‘Counter Strike’, and many other games found on computers and other electronic platforms.  Gone are the familiar ways of Filipinos. Gone is the face-to-face interaction of playing with friends, cousins and relatives. Gone is the fun-filled playful afternoon. Gone are the Philippine traditional games.",
      "To help today’s youth remember how things used to be, our Buwan ng Wika celebration included traditional larong Pinoy, which are considered vital to our heritage.",
      "This year, the college added significantly more to the number of games that were played, all of which required teamwork and intense physical activity, a departure from just sitting on the couch and pressing the buttons of an Xbox or swiping fingers on an iPad.",
      "Not only did we get in a good sweat, but we also nourished our hearts and souls. Just as they have for generations, these games can serve as a positive influence to our mental, emotional, social and moral being. Our traditions and heritage can be revived if our children take up these games all throughout their adolescent and adult lives.",
      "Yes, we will have another chance to enjoy larong Pinoy next August, but even before then, I hope we can play these games more often.",
      "BSBA Reigns in Lakandula and Lakambini 2014",
      "To top off this year’s Buwan ng Wika, Goldenstate held its annual beauty- and brain- pageant, ‘Lakandula and Lakambining Buwanng Wika.’ This year’s winners were both from the Bachelor of Science in Business Adminstration department.",
      "Our country’s rich cultural heritage was the theme for the event.  Donning authentic traditional and native costumes, the contestants displayed style and grace as they introduced themselves to the crowd.",
      "Afterwards, the contestants changed their outfits to colorful and customary Filipiniana- Barong Tagalog attire. Each participant showcased vibrancy with the designs of their garments.",
      "The competition concluded with the question-and-answer portion.  All of the candidates gave very respectable answers, giving the panel of judges difficulty in deciding the winners. Ultimately, the titles were awarded to two BSBA students– Ms. Raquel Dingal, 2nd year, and Mr. Ronnel Jess Langomez, 1st year.",
      "Congratulations to all the participants and mostly to the BSBA department for embodying the poise and intelligence of the ideal Filipino and Filipina.",

      "From the afternoon and well into the night, the atmosphere of this year’s Acquaintance Party at the Anchor Driving Range was electric with the collective excitement of students, staff, and honored guests.  The level of enthusiasm lasted throughout the event, coming to a crescendo at certain points, but overall the buzz could be felt the entire night of August 15, 2014.",
      "Even the preparation leading up to the event was action-packed.  Organizing the event was a two-month endeavor headed by M. Jen Manilay and her team, as well as Sir JV Manuel, who was in charge of sponsorship acquisitions, and Sir Jay Castorio, the Master of Ceremonies.  “It was an exciting process,” said M. Jen of the many hours logged for meetings, phone calls, and simply getting things done for the party. For her and the whole organizing committee, the ultimate goal, in addition to the monetary proceeds for much-needed campus resources, is for students to have fun.  “It’s nice to see the enjoyment of the students,” M. Jen says,  “after all of the hard work of everyone.”",
      "All of their efforts certainly paid off the next day at the Anchor Driving Range.  The event went off to a rousing start with the Open Jam, as performances from students and other locals were met with the screams of the audience.  With a pre-show like this, everyone in attendance was in for a very fun evening.",
      "The Acquaintance Party was officially kicked off with the invocation, national anthem, school hymn, and a special dance performance.  The Sinag Dance Troupe, who had been practicing for months, along with members of the faculty (including myself), who had just learned the dance the day before, entertained the still-growing crowd with a peppy routine set to Pharrell’s “Happy.”  For me, it was all a blur, but the audience seemed to like it.",
      "The general enthusiasm of the students remained at a fever pitch with the start of the Battle of the Bands.  Judged by myself along two members of the Cuerdas Band, who would be performing later, each participating musical act kept the adoring crowd.  Even as the rain started trickling down, the good times would not cease; the students simply covered their heads with makeshift umbrellas and continued cheering on their favorite contestants.",
      "After the raffle drawing, the Cuerdas Band took to the stage and sent the crowd into frenzy with their hyperactive brand of ska-infused reggae.  Everyone in the crowd was jumping, screaming, and singing along to their favorite songs.  Around this time the rain stopped, which was very much welcome, not that anyone really seemed to notice.",
      "At the end of the Cuerdas Band’s first set of the night, there was a brief lull, which in hindsight had been the calm before the storm.  The swells of teenage screams sounded abruptly.  Many of these girls were utterly hysterical, though some thankfully have the self-awareness to grin and laugh about their temporary mania.  With all the fevered shrieks and whispers from the girls (and some boys) in the audience, it was quite apparent who was entering the vicinity.  Then, in the distance, emerged the four maputi chisled Adonises known collectively as 1:43.  Every girl in attendance went ballistic as the boy band was escorted by security to the stage.",
      "When the boys of 1:43 started their performance, it was clear why they were of the objects of affection for so many of the young females in the crowd.  The hit group captivated these girls with their smooth vocals, impossibly good looks, and overall affable charm.  There was no mystery as to why they were awarded the 2014 GMMSF Award for Most Promising Group—the infatuation of their fans in the audience was certainly a good indicator.",
      "Yet, the elation of the crowd would not fade even after 1:43 left the stage.  With Cuerdas Band performing their second set of the night, the students continued to revel in the evening’s festivities, their activity level seemingly endless.  Then came the awarding of prizes for Best Dressed of the Night and the winners of the Battle of the Bands.  1:43 was brought back to the stage, much to the delight of the females in the crowd.  Then came Cuerdas Band’s third performance of the night, and sure enough, the crowd continued to dance around, though some decided to stop to eat or take selfies.",
      "After 1:43 and other guests were presented awards of appreciation and the Sinag Dance Troupe performed for a second time, one would think that the energy of the students would wane.  However, with Cuerdas Band – the hardest-working group I have ever seen and my vote for the MVPs of the night other than M. Jen, Sr. JV, and Sr. Jay—taking to the stage for their fourth set, the crowd continued their fun.  Sr. Jay even joined in on percussion.  With midnight approaching, the students continued to dance to hard-thumping house music, showing almost no signs of exhaustion.",
      "Seeing the ostensibly never-ending energy of the students was a sure sign that this year’s Acquaintance Party was a complete success.  The constant state of excitement and enthusiasm of the students in attendance realized the goals of M. Jen, Sr. JV, Sr. Jay, and everyone who put so much effort into this night.  It will be interesting to see what they will do for next year’s Acquaintance Party, but there is no doubt that the students, staff, and other guests in attendance will have a good time."

      "Spearheaded by the beloved City Mayor Peter B. Miguel and partnered by the different government agencies and offices as well as the different NGOs in the city, all Secondary and Tertiary Colleges and Universities actively participated also in this once a year event dubbed as the Tree Growing Festival 2014.  The event kicked-off off last June 29, 2014 at the City Hall grounds where thousands of participants including the 200 students and Faculty and Staff members of Goldensate College of Koronadal converged and witnessed the official ceremonial opening of the Festival.",
      "Immediately thereafter, our students proceeded at their designated area in Purok Upper Cacub where they were supposed to plant seedlings provided by the City Government. The faculty and staff of Goldenstate College joined also in digging up the grounds where they placed all the seedlings given to them. Long trails, muddy walkways, slippery rocks on the rivers were never a hindrance in this once a year worthy activity. Truly, this event has been a part of Goldenstate College’s program of activities at the start of every school year, for we here at the college always adhere to the call of the world in promoting a greener, newer and safer landscape for us and for the future generations.",

      "General Santos City – It was a picture of almost perfect execution, ornamented with beauty, agility, humility, and magnanimity. This is how the recently concluded college intramurals of Goldenstate College-General Santos went to happen.",
      "The semestral-ending activity was held on September 23-27, 2013 at the General Santos City Sports Complex and at the Trade Hall of SM City Gensan respectively. Chaired by no less than Mr. John Ralph T. Manilay, Development Office Head of the school,  the five-day event was divided into two phases: Sports Activity (September 23-25 at Sports Complex) and the Literary-Musical Events with Mr. & Miss Goldenstate pageant (September 26-27 at SM City Trade Hall).",
      "This year, there are only four divisions which competed in the sporting and non-sporting events (excluding Goldenstate College-Koronadal City which was the Division 5 last year). These are the Division 1 composed of students taking up HRM course; Division 2 consisting of students from  Computer Hardware Servicing NC II (CHS), Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), and Associate in Computer Technology (ACT); Division 3 composed of the students coming from Bachelor of Science in Tourism (BST), Consumer Electronics Servicing NC II (CES), Two-year Midwifery, Two-year Pharmacy, Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy (BS Pharm), and Automotive Servicing NC II, and the Division 4 composed of students from the Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM).",
      "More grandiose than before, the opening salvo on day 1 saw the colorful and festive mood of the atmosphere at the Sports complex as all divisions paraded their stuffs, their cheerdancers accompanied by their division advisers, and athletes. It was a day full of hurrahs and yells so loud that it almost deafened an ordinary man’s ear especially when the highly anticipated cheerdance competition was showcased. Other competitions set in the morning of day 1 were the t-shirts design (won by Division 3), banner raising (won by Division 3), banner design (won by Division 4), parade (won by Division 4), and cheerdance (won by Division 3). In the afternoon of the same day was the commencement of the different ball games such as softball women, basketball (M/W), athletics, sepak takraw, volleyball (M/W), chess (M/W), dart (M/W), table tennis (M/W), soccer football (M), among others.",
      "Day Two was witnessed by the continuation of the ballgames plus the energetic and fun some hosting craft of Madam Josie and Sir Allan to entertain the crowd as well as to announce the event results every now and then. The day ended with the marathon participated by all the members of the faculty and staff led by CEO Dr. Warren A. Manilay, MNSA.",
      "Equally important too, was the conclusion of the ballgames on Day three with a big bang as a large gathering of crowd composed of all the students present, faculty members, staff, and the working students did the synchronized dancing in the tune of the zumba. It was the biggest attended zumba dance craze in recent history of Goldenstate College.",
      "On Day four, the Literary-Musical Events with Talent Showcase by the candidates of Mr. & Ms. Goldenstate was held, for the first time, at SM Trade Hall, SM City of General Santos. Chaired by Mr. Roger A. Pauya in cooperation with all the General Education Department Instructors, the events contested were as follows: Literary – quiz bee, spelling bee, extemporaneous speaking contest, newscasting; Musical – vocal solo, duet, pop dance, ballroom (teacher and student category), and the Talent Showcase for the pageant candidates. It was a day filled with excitements, surprises, and upsets as the battle of the wits and bodies were witnessed.",
      "Day Five, held on the same venue, concluded the five-day intramurals meet of Goldenstate College-Gensan with the staging of this year’s search for the ambassadors of beauty and goodwill- the search for Mr. & Ms. Goldenstate. Hosted by Mr. Ferdinand Alcantara and Mr. Jay Costorio, the classical-turned-stylish-fashionable pageant was well attended by distinguished jurors and crowded by the eager and still high-spirited audience from all divisions who are cheering for their bets. Unique as it is, there were eight female candidates and four male candidates who vied for the coveted title. The momentum of the event had continuously gone high when the announcement of the beauty titlists was announced. Surprisingly, the winners for this year’s Mr. & Ms. Goldenstate went to both the candidates of Division 4 (Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management).",
      "At the end of the day, everybody was considered the winners in all the events. But the one which had received the laurels of triumph was the Division 4 which was declared the Over-all Champions in the 2013 Intramurals of Goldenstate College-General Santos.",
