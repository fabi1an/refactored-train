“Once a Goldenian, always a Goldenian.”

Dear Goldenian,
It’s been a while, hasn’t it?

Do you ever catch yourself thinking about the old days—walking past the glass facade of Goldenstate College for the first time, nervously asking where to enroll, finding your way through the hallways that would soon feel like home?
Do you remember the friendships that blossomed in between classes, the laughter, the heartbreaks, the unforgettable moments? The teachers who shaped you—some you admired, others you tolerated—but all of them part of your story.

Well, this is your invitation to come home.

On May 10, 2020, we’re opening our doors and hearts once again for the Grand Alumni Homecoming at Goldenstate College. It’s more than just a party—it’s a reunion of stories, smiles, and Goldenian pride.

🟡 Registration Fee: ₱500 (includes lunch)
📍 Venue: Goldenstate College – Main Campus
📅 Deadline of Payment: April 30, 2020
👕 Limited-edition shirts will also be available at the venue!

Bring your batchmates, your class divas, kings, dancers—this is your time to shine again! Join the singing and dance contests for a chance to win exciting prizes and relive the fun of your college days.

Let’s fill the campus once more with familiar laughter, music, and memories. Let’s come home.

For questions or more info, feel free to message Ms. Berlyn Sumagaysay on Facebook Messenger.
To register, look for Ms. Maria Lou Sericon at the Main Campus.

See you soon, Goldenian. Your story continues—right where it all began.
