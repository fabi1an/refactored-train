Goldenstate College of General Santos City held simultaneous seminars on February 8–9, 2014, at its campus to update students on current industry practices and technologies. Experts from Manila and DepEd General Santos led the sessions.

The first seminar took place on the morning of February 8 in room N105. Over 20 first- and second-year students from the AB English and Early Childhood Education (ECE) programs attended. The seminar aimed to improve communication skills through interactive and collaborative methods and to develop ECE students’ management and teaching abilities. Key speakers Ronnie R. Sunngay, ESP-1 English, and Imelda Martinez led the sessions, with facilitation by Nelida P. Asedillo, retired DepEd English supervisor and current department head of AB English/ECE.

Also on February 8, Dr. Lorenzo C. Lorenzo, MBA, DBM, Dean of the Philippine Women’s University School of Business Administration, conducted a seminar titled “Character and Personality in Business Management Workplace” and “Leadership.” Addressing Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) students, Dr. Lorenzo discussed Mahatma Gandhi’s “7 Things That Would Destroy Society” and the “21 Principles of Leadership.” The seminar included group workshops where students presented assigned tasks.

The third seminar focused on the Abacus Reservation System and lasted a day and a half. Facilitated by Rizan S. Ritas, MSTM, Program Chair and OJT Coordinator at PWU’s School of Tourism, the seminar was held in the HRM laboratory at the SJM building. It was attended by Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management (BST) students and extended into the morning of February 9.

“The seminars reflect Goldenstate’s commitment to equipping students with relevant skills and knowledge to prepare them for their future careers,” a college representative said.
