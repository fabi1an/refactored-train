Goldenstate College of General Santos City conducted simultaneous seminars on February 8–9, 2014, at its campus to provide students with the latest industry practices and upgrade their knowledge on current technologies. Resource speakers from Manila and DepEd General Santos were invited to lead the sessions.

The first seminar, held on the morning of February 8 in room N105, was attended by over 20 first- and second-year students from the AB English and Early Childhood Education (ECE) programs. The seminar focused on enhancing students’ communication skills through interactive and collaborative methods, as well as developing basic management and teaching skills for ECE students. Ronnie R. Sunngay, ESP-1 English, and Imelda Martinez served as key speakers, while Nelida P. Asedillo, retired DepEd English supervisor and current department head of AB English/ECE, facilitated the event.

On the same day, a seminar titled “Character and Personality in Business Management Workplace” and “Leadership” was conducted by Dr. Lorenzo C. Lorenzo, MBA, DBM, Dean of the Philippine Women’s University School of Business Administration in Manila. Dr. Lorenzo, a PACUCOA accreditor and human resource management expert, discussed Mahatma Gandhi’s “7 Things That Would Destroy Society” and lectured on the “21 Principles of Leadership” to Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) students. The seminar included a workshop where students collaborated in groups to present assigned activities.

The third seminar, which lasted a day and a half, focused on the Abacus Reservation System and was facilitated by Rizan S. Ritas, MSTM, Program Chair and OJT Coordinator of PWU’s School of Tourism. This seminar, held in the HRM laboratory at the SJM building, was attended by Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management (BST) students and continued into the morning of February 9.

“The seminars reflect Goldenstate’s commitment to equipping students with relevant skills and knowledge that will prepare them for the challenges in their fields,” said a college representative.
