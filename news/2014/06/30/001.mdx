Goldenstate College actively participated in the 20th anniversary celebration of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Region XII, held on May 19–20, 2014, in Koronadal City. The milestone event marked the first time CHED held a regional celebration involving higher education institutions (HEIs) and state universities across Region XII.

The celebration began with a grand parade and motorcade along the main streets of Koronadal, culminating at the CHED Regional Office with a ceremonial ribbon cutting. Dr. Maximo C. Aljibe, CHED Regional Director, officially opened the event, joined by college and university administrators. A key highlight was the much-anticipated booth competition featuring creative exhibits from various HEIs.

Goldenstate College stood out throughout the celebration. The institution earned recognition in multiple categories, including accolades for its participation in the World Food Festival in Vietnam and its outreach program for typhoon victims in Compostela Valley.

“Our efforts in academic and social initiatives are always anchored on the values of service and excellence,” shared Mrs. Josie Yap Tirador, MBA, College President.

Dr. Warren A. Manilay, MNSA, CEO of Goldenstate College, was also honored as one of the region’s most active HEI association officers. His award was received by his son, Mr. John Ralph T. Manilay, alongside Vice President for Finance Mrs. Sara Jane T. Manilay and President Tirador.

The celebration concluded with a cocktail dinner and awarding ceremony at the South Cotabato Gymnasium. The pinnacle moment was the announcement of Goldenstate College as the Best Booth Competition winner, earning the gold for its exhibit themed “Sharing Goldenstate College’s Best to the World.”

“It’s a proud moment not just for our school but for every student and faculty member who contributed to this achievement,” said Mr. John Ralph T. Manilay, Development and Planning Officer.

The event highlighted the collaborative spirit and growing excellence of higher education institutions across the region, with Goldenstate College emerging as one of its leading contributors.
