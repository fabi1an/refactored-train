Goldenstate College of Koronadal joined the city government of Koronadal for the third consecutive year in supporting the city’s environmental advocacy to create a greener and healthier landscape. This effort aligns with the global call for environmental preservation and was part of the Tree Growing Festival 2014 held on June 29, 2014.

The event was spearheaded by City Mayor Peter B. Miguel and involved various government agencies, offices, and non-government organizations. Thousands of participants, including 200 students, faculty, and staff members of Goldenstate College, gathered at the City Hall grounds for the festival’s official ceremonial opening.

Following the ceremony, Goldenstate students and staff proceeded to Purok Upper Cacub, their designated planting site, where they planted tree seedlings provided by the city government. Faculty and staff actively took part in preparing the soil and planting the seedlings despite challenging conditions such as muddy trails, slippery rocks, and river crossings.

“This yearly event reflects our commitment to environmental stewardship and is integrated into our college’s activities at the start of every school year,” said a college representative. “We believe in promoting a greener, safer, and more sustainable landscape for current and future generations.”

The Tree Growing Festival continues to inspire the Goldenstate community to take part in preserving Mother Earth through meaningful action.
