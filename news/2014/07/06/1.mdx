Goldenstate college of koronadal inc. on its 3rd straight year had again joined the city government of koronadal in its advocacy in creating a newer and greener landscape for the city, thus, taking part in the preservation of our environment and saving our mother earth.

Spearheaded by the beloved city mayor peter b. miguel and partnered by the different government agencies and offices as well as the different ngos in the city, all secondary and tertiary colleges and universities actively participated also in this once a year event dubbed as the tree growing festival 2014. the event kicked-off off last june 29, 2014 at the city hall grounds where thousands of participants including the 200 students and faculty and staff members of goldensate college of koronadal converged and witnessed the official ceremonial opening of the festival.

Immediately thereafter, our students proceeded at their designated area in purok upper cacub where they were supposed to plant seedlings provided by the city government. the faculty and staff of goldenstate college joined also in digging up the grounds where they placed all the seedlings given to them. long trails, muddy walkways, slippery rocks on the rivers were never a hindrance in this once a year worthy activity. truly, this event has been a part of goldenstate college’s program of activities at the start of every school year, for we here at the college always adhere to the call of the world in promoting a greener, newer and safer landscape for us and for the future generations.

The journey starts here.
