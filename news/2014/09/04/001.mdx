On August 15, 2014, the Anchor Driving Range in General Santos City buzzed with excitement as students, staff, and honored guests gathered for this year’s acquaintance party. The energetic atmosphere lasted from the afternoon well into the night, creating a memorable celebration for everyone involved.

Preparations for the event took two months, led by M. Jen Manilay and her team, with Sir JV Manuel handling sponsorships and Sir Jay Castorio serving as master of ceremonies. “It was an exciting process,” said M. Jen, “and it’s rewarding to see students enjoy themselves after all the hard work.”

The event opened with an open jam featuring student and local performers, setting a lively tone. The formal program began with an invocation, national anthem, school hymn, and a special dance performance by the Sinag Dance Troupe. Faculty members, including some who learned the dance just the day before, joined the troupe in performing a routine to Pharrell’s “Happy,” much to the audience’s delight.

Next came the battle of the bands, judged by the author and two members of the Cuerdas band, who performed later that evening. Despite light rain, the crowd’s enthusiasm remained high, with students shielding themselves and cheering on their favorite acts.

Following the raffle, the Cuerdas band took the stage with their energetic ska-infused reggae, igniting the crowd with high-energy performances. When the rain stopped, few seemed to notice, so absorbed were they in the festivities.

The night reached a fever pitch with the arrival of 1:43, a popular boy band whose smooth vocals and charm sent the female audience into a frenzy. Awarded the 2014 GMMSF Most Promising Group, their performance captivated fans throughout the venue.

Even after 1:43’s first set, the party continued strong with multiple performances by the Cuerdas band and the awarding of prizes for best dressed and battle of the bands winners. The boy band returned to the stage to the crowd’s delight, while many danced, ate, and took selfies.

The evening closed with a final round of performances from the Cuerdas band and the Sinag Dance Troupe, as students danced to house music late into the night. The energy and enthusiasm demonstrated by attendees reflected the success of the event and the dedication of the organizing team.

“This year’s acquaintance party was a complete success,” said M. Jen Manilay. “It’s exciting to think about what next year’s celebration will bring, but one thing is certain — everyone had a fantastic time.”
