The holiday season officially began at Goldenstate College with a bright and joyful bang on December 1, thanks to the very first Light-a-Tree Countdown Celebration!

Organized by Mr. John Manilay, Head of the Development Office, the event brought the whole campus together for a fun, creative, and eco-friendly competition. In the weeks leading up to the big night, departments worked hard decorating Christmas trees using recycled materials—yep, plastic cups, old CDs, and scrap items became snowmen, nativity scenes, and even Santa Claus. The only exception? Twinkling lights.

Before the lights came on, the courtyard buzzed with excitement as students, staff, and guests explored a mini Christmas bazaar. Food, treats, and handmade goodies were up for sale—all prepared by different departments.

The official program kicked off with Sir John’s opening remarks, followed by a surprise birthday serenade for CEO Dr. Warren Manilay, MNSA. After sharing a heartfelt message, Dr. Manilay thanked everyone for their efforts and joined in the celebration.

Then came the main event. The lights dimmed. The countdown began. And—boom!—the whole courtyard lit up with glowing trees, turning the campus into a Christmas wonderland. But it didn’t stop there. Each team also delivered a caroling performance—some simple and sweet, others full-on musical productions with dance moves!

The Sinag Dance Troupe wowed the crowd as the judges—Sir Ferdinand Alcantara, Ma’am LJ Pulido, and Sir Joaquin Suaverdez—tallied the scores. In the end, Division 2 took the top spot, but the night was a win for everyone who joined in.

The Light-a-Tree Countdown was a perfect way to ring in December—filled with fun, teamwork, and holiday spirit. We can’t wait to see what next year brings!
