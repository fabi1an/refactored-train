Did you notice Division 4 is once again the overall champion of Intramurals 2014? Sir Chris Mordeno, the division’s adviser, shared how his students pushed themselves to their limits, deploying those with the best talents and skills to secure victories across all events.

The four-day event began on Monday, September 22, at the Lagao Gymnasium with literary and musical competitions. Students from the four divisions competed in quiz bowl, spelling bee, extemporaneous speaking, newscasting, and solo and duet singing. The afternoon featured the final rounds of the much-anticipated Mr. and Ms. Goldenstate pageants.

Sports competitions took place over the next three days at the Acharon Sports Complex in Calumpang. Each division showcased sportsmanship and determination in basketball, volleyball, kickball, soccer, sepak takraw, tennis, chess, track and field, long jump, and darts. Though competition was fierce, Division 4 ultimately claimed the overall championship amid loud cheers from their fellow Goldenians.

The week’s festivities concluded with exhibition games between faculty and staff and a lively all-school Zumba workout, celebrating health and fitness across the campus.

“This is the right time to develop good sportsmanship,” said CEO Dr. Warren T. Manilay, MNSA, during his opening remarks. Throughout the intramurals, all participants exemplified this spirit.

**A Battle of Brains and Talent**

Monday’s literary and musical competitions opened with the quiz bowl, where Division 3 took first place, and the spelling bee, won by Division 4. The extemporaneous speaking and newscasting rounds followed, with Division 4 prevailing despite some technical challenges. The day concluded with solo and duet singing performances, showcasing creativity and resilience from all divisions.

**“Gods and Goddesses” Shine in Pageant**

The Mr. and Ms. Goldenstate College 2014 pageant, themed “Gods and Goddesses,” was a highlight of the week. Candidates from each division showcased beauty, grace, and wit through various challenges.

Pictorials were held on September 14 at the Ancestral House, featuring formal and themed costumes. Talent competitions took place on September 20, and the grand coronation was held on September 23 at Lagao Gymnasium.
