Every August, the Philippines observes *Buwan ng Wikang Pambansa* to highlight the importance of the Filipino language. This year’s theme, announced by the Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino (KWF), was **“Wikang Filipino, Wikang Pagkakaisa”** (Filipino Language, Language of Unity).

The month-long celebration is based on Presidential Proclamation No. 1041 (1997), encouraging Filipinos—especially the youth—to deepen their appreciation of the national language through various cultural activities. The initiative also aims to foster pride in Filipino traditions and promote the language as the heart and soul of the nation.

Goldenstate College, under the Filipino Department led by Arnold Sugan, organized a two-day festival on August 28 and 29, 2014, featuring a wide range of events. These included slogan and poster making contests, essay writing (sanaysay), traditional Filipino games (*larong pinoy*), interpretative and folk dances, poetry recitation (*sabayang bigkasan*), speeches, and solo and duet singing competitions. The celebration culminated with the much-anticipated *Lakandula* and *Lakambining Buwan ng Wika* pageant.

### Larong Pinoy: Traditional Games Played by Today’s Youth

Reflecting on childhood, one faculty member shared how their early years were filled with outdoor games like *piko*, *patintero*, *tagu-taguan*, *sungka*, *holen*, *luksong tinik*, *luksong lubid*, and *hiliang lubid*. These games fostered social interaction and cultural roots.

In contrast, today’s children often engage with electronic games such as *DOTA* and *Counter Strike*, missing out on physical activity and face-to-face connection. To revive these Filipino traditions, this year’s celebration included an expanded lineup of *larong pinoy* that emphasized teamwork and active participation.

Participants not only enjoyed physical exercise but also nourished their social and moral values, reaffirming the significance of preserving Filipino cultural heritage.

### BSBA Reigns in Lakandula and Lakambini 2014

The festival’s highlight was the annual *Lakandula and Lakambining Buwan ng Wika* beauty and brain pageant. This year’s theme celebrated the country’s rich cultural heritage, with contestants donning traditional Filipino costumes.

Contestants showcased elegance and cultural pride wearing native attire, then changed into colorful *Filipiniana* and *Barong Tagalog* outfits. The competition ended with a challenging question-and-answer segment, where all candidates impressed the judges.

The titles went to two Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) students: Ms. Raquel Dingal, 2nd year, and Mr. Ronnel Jess Langomez, 1st year. Their win embodied the poise, intelligence, and cultural spirit of the ideal Filipino.

### Faculty Show Their Moves

During the folk dance competition, faculty members surprised many with their dance skills, showing strong participation beyond academics.

### A Climb for the Prize

One of the traditional highlights was the *palo sebo*—a slippery bamboo pole climb where a student competed to reach the prize at the top, embodying the spirit of Filipino games and celebration.

The festival successfully reminded everyone of the vital role language and culture play in national progress and unity. It also encouraged youth and community members to continue valuing and practicing Filipino traditions despite modern influences.
