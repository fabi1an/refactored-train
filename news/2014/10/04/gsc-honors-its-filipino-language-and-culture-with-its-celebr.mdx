Every august, the country celebrates buwan ng wikang pambansa, highlighting our filipino language. the komisyon ng wikang filipino (kwf) announced that the theme for this year’s celebration would be ‘wikang filipino, wikang pagkakaisa’.

The celebration of buwan ng wikang pambansa is in keeping with presidential proclamation no. 1041 s. 1997 (month long celebration of buwanngwika every august), meant to encourage all filipinos, and especially the youth, to develop their appreciation for their national language by means of participation in all activities in line with the celebration and to embolden their compatriots through emphasizing greater appreciation and understanding on their traditional activities and making their language the heart and light of the nation.

To make all these objectives come to life, goldenstate college, inc. under the supervision of the filipino department, led by head filipino teacher arnold sugan, and with contributions from all departments, organized a two-day festival on august 28 and 29, 2014.

The two-day celebration was comprised of several events, including the slogan and poster making contest, sanaysay making, tagisan at palighasan sa mga tradisyonal na larong pinoy, interpretative dance, folk dance, sabay ang bigkasan, talumpati, solo and duet singing contest, and the highly-anticipated lakandula and lakambining buwan ng wika.

The activity has proven to be a success in reminding filipinos of the importance of language in achieving national progress. it has reinforced the understanding among our youth that no matter how globalization and colonialism has affected their daily lives it is imperative to value and experience all that is naturally and distinctly filipino.

Our coverage of buwan ng wikang pambansa includes features on two particularly important events: the larong pinoy and the lakandula and lakambini.

Larong pinoy: traditional games from yesterday played by the youth of today.

I am one example of a filipino whose formative years were not all about psp and game apps on tablets; i grew up with games played outside of the confines of our house. i grew up with games with lots of interaction with friends, family, and neighbors.

In my early formative years we played piko, we socialized by patintero, tagutaguan, sungka and holen and interacted with other children by doing luksongtinik, luksonglubid and hilianglubid. as you can imagine my younger years were not only about socialization but also about the cultivation of a strong, unique culture within me.

Now children are playing different games. they sit engrossed, with almost lifeless stares, playing ‘dota’, ‘counter strike’, and many other games found on computers and other electronic platforms. gone are the familiar ways of filipinos. gone is the face-to-face interaction of playing with friends, cousins and relatives. gone is the fun-filled playful afternoon. gone are the philippine traditional games.

To help today’s youth remember how things used to be, our buwan ng wika celebration included traditional larong pinoy, which are considered vital to our heritage.

This year, the college added significantly more to the number of games that were played, all of which required teamwork and intense physical activity, a departure from just sitting on the couch and pressing the buttons of an xbox or swiping fingers on an ipad.

Not only did we get in a good sweat, but we also nourished our hearts and souls. just as they have for generations, these games can serve as a positive influence to our mental, emotional, social and moral being. our traditions and heritage can be revived if our children take up these games all throughout their adolescent and adult lives.

Yes, we will have another chance to enjoy larong pinoy next august, but even before then, i hope we can play these games more often.

To top off this year’s buwan ng wika, goldenstate held its annual beauty- and brain- pageant, ‘lakandula and lakambining buwanng wika.’ this year’s winners were both from the bachelor of science in business adminstration department.

Our country’s rich cultural heritage was the theme for the event. donning authentic traditional and native costumes, the contestants displayed style and grace as they introduced themselves to the crowd.

Afterwards, the contestants changed their outfits to colorful and customary filipiniana- barong tagalog attire. each participant showcased vibrancy with the designs of their garments.

The competition concluded with the question-and-answer portion. all of the candidates gave very respectable answers, giving the panel of judges difficulty in deciding the winners. ultimately, the titles were awarded to two bsba students– ms. raquel dingal, 2nd year, and mr. ronnel jess langomez, 1st year.

Congratulations to all the participants and mostly to the bsba department for embodying the poise and intelligence of the ideal filipino and filipina.

Who says faculty members can’t do it on the dance floor? here, our instructors show their skills during the folkdance competition.
