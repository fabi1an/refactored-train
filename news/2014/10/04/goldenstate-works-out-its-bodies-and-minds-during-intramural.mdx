Goldenstate college’s intramurals was a four-day affair, beginning on monday at the lagao gymnasium with the literary and musical competitions. students representing the four divisions competed in the quiz bowl, spelling bee, extemporaneous speaking, news casting, and solo and duet singing. in the afternoon were the final rounds of the mr. and ms. goldenstate pageants.

The physical competitions were held during the following three days at the acharon sports complex, calumpang. each division displayed exemplary sportsmanship and character while vying for the honor of being named overall champion. though divison 4 would ultimately earn that distinction, it is clear that every competitor gave her or his best effort in front of the large crowd of fellow goldenians who cheered them on.

A battle of brains and vocal range.

Monday’s literary and musical competitions at the began with quiz bowl followed by spelling bee all divisions performed well, but division three bagged the first place at quiz bowl and division four for spelling bee.

With all of the female candidates on the stage in their formalwear, the gymnasium went wild when guest performers 1:43 entered to serenade the lovely ladies.

This all lead to perhaps the most nerve-wracking portion of the pageant, the q&a. each contestant anwered a randomly selected question, and despite some initial fluster on the faces of some of the candidates, each was able to issue an impassioned and articulate response.

Before the coronation, a series of special awards were given. both awards for best in talent were given to students from division 1. peoples’ choice were awarded to division 2 (male) and division 4 (female). most photogenic were given to division 3 (male) and division 4 (female). the congeniality awards were given division 1. best in jeans were awarded to division 1 (male) and division 3 (female). students from division 4 were named mr. and ms. coca-cola. mr. and ms. tm were awarded to students from division 2. finally, the metro collection awards were given to students from division 1.
