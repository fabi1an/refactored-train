The Tuna Skills Olympics began in 2006 under the leadership of Dr. Warren A. Manilay, MNSA, CEO of Goldenstate College, and College President Ms. Josie Y. Tirador. By 2007, it became an official part of the Tuna Festival and was formally recognized in 2008 by the Tuna Council as a regular city event. Since then, the competition has grown to include participants from as far as Davao and North Cotabato, attracting aspiring hospitality professionals to showcase their skills in a friendly, competitive setting.

Sponsors of the event included KCC Malls (venue partner), Dole Philippines, Globe Telecom, Petron Gasul, Grab-a-Crab Restaurant, Universal Robina Corporation, Avon Cosmetics, the Philippine Fisheries Development Authority, and the Philippine Foremost Milling Corporation. Each provided product support and prizes for the winners, helping sustain the event’s continued success.

“The Tuna Skills Olympics helps young talents sharpen their skills while celebrating the city’s most valuable resource — tuna,” said one of the event coordinators. “This is more than a contest; it’s training ground for future professionals in the hospitality industry.”

The event closed with award presentations and a show of appreciation to sponsors, participants, and organizers, looking forward to its 10th year of celebration in 2015.
