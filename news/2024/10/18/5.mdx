“the charity that is a trifle to us can be precious to others.”.

– homer –.

This quote was embodied by the bstm departmental officers as they stepped outside the four corners of the classroom to extend their simple help to the affected families of the disheartening fire incident that happened last september 26, 2024 at corros compound, barangay zone iv, koronadal city.

This action was solely initiated and organized by the bstm departmental officers, with help from the cbm students.

Together, they have proved that it doesn’t need a million to show benevolence to others, because even a simple act of kindness can truly alleviate a burden.

We are truly proud of our student leaders and their dedication to contribute not only to their department, but also to the community.
