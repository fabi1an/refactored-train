The recently concluded bs tourism management seminar and workshop 2024 was an inspiring, morally-uplifting and informative event that aimed to equip the next generation of tourism professionals with innovative skills and knowledge.

Held this afternoon of october 11, 2024, the seminar brought together the gsck – bs tourism management students, as they grasp and acquire information about the essential things to remember for the young tourism professionals as they start to venture out in their respective tourism-related professions in the future.

This event was successfully organized by the third year bstm students as part of their major requirements in their professional development and applied ethics (thc 6) subject.

This seminar was led by ma’am jellybee baay-principe, lpt, mpa, as their guest speaker. she shared informative insights paired with innovative discussion that surely awakened the desires of the students to persevere and to explore the wide-ranged professional world of the tourism industry.

Thank you, bstm students for attending and for activity participating.
