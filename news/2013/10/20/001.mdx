Goldenstate College of General Santos City concluded its five-day Intramurals 2013 celebration from September 23 to 27 at the General Santos City Sports Complex and SM City Gensan Trade Hall. The event combined spirited competitions, cultural showcases, and student camaraderie, marking one of the most vibrant school celebrations in recent history.

The highlight was Division 4 (BSHRM) emerging as the overall champion, dominating both sporting events and pageant categories.

The festivities kicked off with a colorful parade and cheerleading competitions. Division 3 won the Cheerdance and Banner Raising, while Division 4 took home victories in Parade and Banner Design. Sports contests included basketball, volleyball, softball, sepak takraw, chess, table tennis, and soccer.

Days two and three maintained the momentum with ongoing games and lively hosting by Madam Josie and Sir Allan. A standout moment was the Mass Zumba Craze—an unprecedented synchronized dance event involving thousands of students, faculty, and staff.

On day four, literary and musical competitions moved to SM City Gensan Trade Hall, featuring quiz bees, spelling bees, extemporaneous speaking, newscasting, vocal performances, dances, ballroom contests, and talent showcases.

The grand finale was the Mr. & Ms. Goldenstate 2013 pageant, judged by esteemed jurors and hosted by Mr. Ferdinand Alcantara and Mr. Jay Costorio. Both titles were claimed by candidates from Division 4.

In the end, Division 4 was declared the official overall champion of the 2013 Intramurals, underscoring their excellence across academics, sports, and the arts.
