Holy Infant School of Malungon (HISM), an affiliate of Goldenstate College, marked its 41st founding anniversary on January 15, 2025, with a day of activities highlighting faith, culture, and family unity.

The celebration began with a Holy Mass at the school grounds, attended by students, parents, alumni, faculty, and local residents. The mass honored the institution’s commitment to faith-based education and community service.

A Sinulog dance presentation followed, showcasing colorful and vibrant cultural performances that reflected the school’s connection to local traditions.

The event also featured Family Day, where games, entertainment, and shared meals brought families and the school community together for a day of bonding and celebration.

The entire celebration was spearheaded by the dedicated HISM faculty and staff, whose efforts ensured the success of the activities. The anniversary served as a heartfelt tribute to the institution’s legacy of excellence, and a reaffirmation of its mission to nurture future generations through faith-based education.

As HISM looks ahead, the event not only celebrated the past 41 years of achievements but also reflected the school’s continued growth and the promise of a bright future ahead.
