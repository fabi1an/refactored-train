A spirit of generosity and compassion filled the Goldenstate College Main Campus in General Santos City on December 14, 2024, as students, faculty, and staff came together for the “Pamaskong Handog”—a heartfelt gift-giving led by Dr. Sara T. Manilay, Vice President of Goldenstate College, and the Manilay family.

The initiative, organized under the Golden Cares community outreach banner, extended warmth and joy to children and families in the local community. With genuine care and personal involvement, Dr. Manilay and her family personally handed out gifts, connecting with each recipient and bringing smiles to faces both young and old.

The celebration went beyond the exchange of presents—it was a day filled with laughter, festive spirit, and the strong sense of togetherness that defines the Christmas season. The college campus came alive with holiday cheer as beneficiaries received their gifts and enjoyed the joyful atmosphere created by the Goldenstate community.

This meaningful event reflected the institution’s enduring mission: to serve not only through education, but also through acts of kindness that uplift lives. The “Pamaskong Handog” has become more than just an annual tradition—it is a reminder of the values that Goldenstate College upholds: compassion, service, and community engagement.

As the day came to a close, expressions of gratitude echoed throughout the campus. Organizers and volunteers celebrated the success of the event, thankful for every helping hand and every smile shared. It was, indeed, a memorable and meaningful celebration of the season.

From Goldenstate College to the entire community—Merry, Merry Christmas!
