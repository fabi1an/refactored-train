The students of the college of business and management (cbm) department actively participated in a 1-day seminar and workshop on photography that was led by sir gerald gulmatico ruplo, mit, where he discussed basic information and things to consider and remember about the world of photography and digital marketing.

This activity was subdivided into two parts, wherein the first part was intended for the seminar and discussion, and the second part was intended for the workshop where the students captured and submitted their own photo entries.

This seminar and workshop was organized by the cbm departmental officers and was participated by all year levels of the bs tourism management and bs business administration â€“ mm programs.

Indeed, it was an informative and relevant activity that surely gave the students some useful insights that they can apply to level up their whole photography experiences and make their digital marketing skills more effective.
