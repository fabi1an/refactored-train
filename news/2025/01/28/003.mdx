Goldenstate College's College of Business and Management (CBM) students took part in a one-day seminar and workshop titled “Frame the Future: Capturing Moments, Crafting Digital Presence”, led by Sir Gerald Gulmatico Ruplo, MIT. Hosted on campus, the event aimed to enhance both the photography skills and digital marketing know-how of the participants.

The program was divided into two parts: a morning session focused on photography fundamentals—composition, lighting, framing—and digital marketing essentials for effective visual storytelling online. In the afternoon, students engaged in a hands-on workshop, capturing and submitting their own photo entries for evaluation.

The activity–organized by CBM departmental officers–was attended by students across all year levels of the BS Tourism Management and BS Business Administration – Major in Marketing Management programs. Participants expressed appreciation for the balance of theory and practical application, describing the workshop as “insightful” and “relevant.”

As visual content continues to drive online engagement and brand visibility, events like this equip students with skills that are increasingly in demand. With refined photography techniques and marketing strategies, they are better prepared to represent businesses and promotions in a competitive digital environment.

Goldenstate College underscores its commitment to developing professionals who are not only academically competent but also digitally savvy—capable of navigating both business and social media landscapes with confidence.
