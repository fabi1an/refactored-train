Modesto I. Ulpindo III, a Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM) graduate from Goldenstate College–Koronadal, Class of 2014, has achieved remarkable success in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), climbing the ranks in the international hospitality industry.

Armed with strong leadership skills and practical training from Goldenstate College, Ulpindo served as a shift supervisor at Caribou Coffee for five years before rising to his current position as store manager at Khave Donyasi, a prominent café in the UAE.

Goldenstate College’s hospitality program continues to equip students with the global competencies and industry experience needed to excel abroad. Ulpindo’s journey is a testament to the college’s commitment to producing world-ready professionals.

Recently, his success story came full circle when he met with Dr. Warren A. Manilay (CEO and President), Dr. Sara Manilay (VP for Finance), and Bim Andales (staff) during their official visit to the UAE—a proud moment for both Ulpindo and his alma mater.
