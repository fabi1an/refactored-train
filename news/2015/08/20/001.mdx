Year after year, the acquaintance party has been a fun way to cap off the beginning of the goldenstate school year, and this year’s event was no different. on july 31, students, faculty, and honored guests converged upon the anchor driving range for food, music, and the enjoyment of each other’s company. however, this time around, things got a little bit messy the addition of tons and tons of foam!.

Everyone came together on the dance floor as foamy suds started to pour in – and shoot out from a cannon – and danced the night away to an energetic performance from special guest dj tom taus. the party continued with sets from djs nathaniel “nat” teh, arvin “don juan” pingol, gwens “dj cuteboy” rosanto, and kimber “dj princess” victorioso.

Attendees were also treated to musical numbers from some of goldenstate’s most talented students. after performances from ever-impressive sinag dance troupe and the always-entertaining faculty, there was a dance competition, with students representing each department naenae-ing and poplocking their way into the favor of the judges’ panel, which included dj nat, mr. johann manilay millado, and mr. jon marius tolentino.

As the name of the event would suggest, the acquaintance party provided an opportunity for students to get to know the goldenstate faculty and staff. after opening remarks from ceo dr. warren a. manilay, mnsa, each teacher came on stage for a short introduction. overall, the acquaintance party was a nice way for the entire goldenstate community to come together in the spirit of fun and camaraderie.

In addition to our special guest performers, goldenstate would like to thank the following sponsors, tong yang, steven’s place, canto tapsi bar, robinson’s, mse, pizza hut at kcc, asia brewery, globe telecom, and ton-ton gensan. special thanks also goes to the sarangani golfers club, east asia royale hotel, and b. ads soundsystem.

Hope to see you at the acquaintance party next year!.
